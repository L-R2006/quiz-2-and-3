# Quiz #2 â€” List Transformer

## Overview

This Java program transforms values from two predefined lists, `list1` (integers) and `list2` (strings), into a third list, `list3` (strings). The transformation is based on a specific index mapping pattern, where each element in `list3` is selected from `list2` according to indices provided by the mapping array.

The program prints all three lists with their indices and values, allowing clear visualization of how elements move through the transformation process.
